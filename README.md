> Develop, test, build JavaScript for browser and node.

## Presentation

Put here awesome videos (certainly gif) amd screenshots.
The idea is to show the best features:

One feature to highlight: running test files against browser and node and get result + coverage

Other feature that deserves a mention but will
not be highlighted:

- execute/debug your files using the browsing server
- debugging a file on node from vscode in 5s
- debugging a file on chrome from vscode in 5s

## Example

I have made an example repository using jsenv to illustrates how it works: https://github.com/jsenv/sample-project.
This is also the official documentation.
