> Help to create JavaScript module targeting browsers and/or node.js

## Main dependencies

jsenv relies mainly on the following projects:

- https://github.com/babel/babel
- https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs
- https://github.com/rollup/rollup

Thank you to people behind these projects, they helped me a lot.

## History behind jsenv

Two annoying things:

- Tool provides solutions for browsers or node.js, not for both.
- Having to build an entire project to test one file.

The jsenv project was created to help writing modules that can be used inside browsers and node.js.<br />
It also exists to be able to test a file without having to build an entire project.

## What jsenv can do ?

- execute a file inside browsers, node.js.
- execute unit tests on browsers, node.js.
- generate code coverage of unit tests.
- generate bundle compatible with browsers, node.js.

All of the above can be achieved using babel, systemjs, rollup and istanbul separately. But you have to make them work together and it is a lot of work, believe me.

You can also:

- use import starting with / `import from '/src/file.js'`
- use top level await
- use dynamic import
- use import.meta.url

And mainly it's about writing code that can be executed/tested/bundled for the web and node.js.

## Documentation

List of link to the documentation of jsenv internals:

- [browser explorer server](./docs/browser-explorer-server/browser-explorer-server.md)
- [execution](./docs/execution/execution.md)
- [testing](./docs/testing/testing.md)
- [coverage](./docs/coverage/coverage.md)
- [platform launcher](./docs/platform-launcher/platform-launcher.md)
- [bundling](./docs/bundling/bundling.md)

## Example

The `@dmail/assert` module is emblematic of what jsenv can do:

- It can be used on browsers and node.js.
- It needs to run unit tests on a browser and node.js.
- It needs to export bundle that can be used inside a browser or node.js.

Link to the `@dmail/assert` on github : https://github.com/dmail/assert.<br />
I encourage you to check its [package.json scripts](https://github.com/dmail/assert/blob/3a308d2e78b9ea217807e27ed4597fbf71f3903f/package.json#L38-L52).
