> jsenv-core helps to run your JavaScript in well-known scenarios.

## History behind jsenv

One day I realized that:

As a consumer of a module, you **consider only the main file**.<br/>
As a developper of a module, you **consider all the files** composing it.

Unfortunately, most developper tools are made for the consumers: you have to build your entire project to test one file. I found this problematic because it becomes painful or impossible to test a file in isolation from the rest of the project.

jsenv provides a solution to turn any JavaScript file into an entry point.

## Main dependencies

jsenv relies mainly on the following projects:

- https://github.com/babel/babel
- https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs
- https://github.com/rollup/rollup

Thank you to people behind these projects, they helped me a lot.

## Documentation

There is not yet official documentation.
I'm not planning to add it very soon because it's a lot of work and there is an acceptable alternative:

I encourage you to check (my) projects powered by jsenv

- https://github.com/dmail/assert
- https://github.com/dmail/uneval

You can understand how jsenv is meants to be used by checking their package.json scripts section:

## Demonstration

This section will show what is cool about jsenv.

List of cool stuff

- You can use import starting with / `import from '/src/file.js'`
- You can use top level await
- You can use dynamic import
- You can use import.meta.url
- Project browser explorer: server sending a self executing html for every file of your project
- Project code coverage solution
- Project can have several entry points
- Test file contains regular code, no weird syntax/concept like jasmine.
- Test file can be runned on chromium, on nodejs or on both.
- Test file can kill node/chrome with infinite loop, next one guaranteed to run thanks to dedicated node process or chromium instance.
- vscode: one click to debug any file with nodejs debugger
- vscode: one click to debug any file with chrome debugger

TODO: add screenshots, video, whatever to show evidence of the list above :)
