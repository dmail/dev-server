# Before installing a jsenv package

All jsenv packages are published on github and npm package registry.

Packages are published on github registry because it fits naturally with github, where jsenv codebase is developed. They are also published to npm to let you skip the npm configuration for github registry.

If you choose to get it from npm you can skip the documentation below.

# Configuring npm for github registry

In order to use a jsenv package in your project, npm must be configured to search it on the github registry.

You can do that by adding the following line in your `.npmrc`.

```
@jsenv:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

Or the following command

```console
npm config set @jsenv:registry https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

At this point you can `npm install` but if you never configured npm authentification on github registry you're going to see the following error:

![npm install authentification error screenshot](./npm-install-auth-error-screenshot.png)

To fix it you need to configure npm authentification on github registry

## Configure npm authentification on github registry

1. Create a token in your [github settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens) with at leat `read:packages` scope.

2. Save the token with the following command
   ```console
   npm config set //npm.pkg.github.com/:_authToken personal-access-token
   ```
   Replace 'personal-access-token' with your previously generated token.

# Installing the jsenv package

Now npm is properly configured, you can install a package doing

```console
npm install @jsenv/package-name
```

Or

```console
yarn add @jsenv/package-name
```
