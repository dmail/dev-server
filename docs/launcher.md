# launcher

A launcher is a function capable to launch a runtime environment to execute a file.<br />
You can use them to tell on which runtime to execute a file.<br />

For instance the following code would execute `/Users/you/directory/index.js` on Node.js.

```js
import { execute, launchNode } from "@jsenv/core"

execute({
  projectDirectoryUrl: "/Users/you/directory",
  fileRelativeUrl: "./index.js",
  launch: launchNode,
})
```

# Browser launchers

jsenv uses [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) to launch browser runtime environments. If you want to use a browser launcher (launchChromium, launchFirefox or launchWebkit) you need to have the browser executable file somewhere in your project.

For instance if you plan to use `launchChromium`, add `playwright-chromium` to your devDependencies.

```console
npm install --save-dev playwright-chromium
```

For `launchFirefox` you would add `playwright-firefox`

```console
npm install --save-dev playwright-firefox
```

For `launchWebkit` you would add `playwright-webkit`

```console
npm install --save-dev playwright-webkit
```

If you want to manage the browser files yourself you don't have to add these dev dependencies but you must tell jsenv where to find these files. Check [chromiumExecutablePath](./shared-parameters.md#chromiumExecutablePath), [firefoxExecutablePath](./shared-parameters.md#firefoxExecutablePath) and [webkitExecutablePath](./shared-parameters.md#webkitExecutablePath) to do this.

# Passing options to a launcher

You can pass option to a runtime launcher but you have to be sure you forward the options it receives.<br />
By default `launchChromium` execute a file inside a headless chromium, but you can make it launch a chromium with a UI like this:

```js
import { execute, launchChromium } from "@jsenv/core"

execute({
  projectDirectoryUrl: "/Users/you/directory",
  fileRelativeUrl: "./index.js",
  launch: (options) => launchChromium({ ...options, headless: false }),
})
```
