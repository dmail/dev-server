## TODO

- current bundling approach is failing. see chromium launcher now failing
  because it tries to find /node_modules/@jsenv/core/importMap.json
  instead of /importMap.json because every node module '/' is scoped per node module.
  As soon as we try to do '/' inside '/node_modules/@jsenv/core'
  we resolve to '/node_modules/@jsenv/core/importMap.json'
  it needs to be fixed.
  Maybe /importMap.json is the only thing we want
  to get relative to the project and not the module
  so we should just add a notation for that or something
- nothing else :)

## To keep in mind

- Ideally we should not keep our own systemjs version:
  https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/issues/1924 and https://github.com/systemjs/systemjs/pull/1925.
- Ideally we should not keep our own babel-plugin-transform-modules-systemjs version: https://github.com/babel/babel/issues/9426
- externalize logger into @dmail/logger
- Create @jsenv/firefox-launcher because it would be cool
  to be able to test against firefox and puppeteer-firefox should help a lot
- safari-launcher, opera-launcher would be great

### How to use dependency written in commonjs

Some module now have `module` or `jsnext:main` in their `package.json` leading to files written using `import/export`. In that case `importMap.json` generated by `generate-import-map` will contain a remapping to this file and you're good.

Otherwise if you want to use a npm module called `awesome` written using `module.exports`, you can

(a) Use `import.meta.require` if you know your code is meant to be executed only on node:

```js
const awesome = import.meta.require("awesome")
```

(b) Manually convert it to `import/export`:

- Fork the github repository
- Run an automatic tool to transform `module.exports` into `import/export`. For instance https://github.com/tbranyen/babel-plugin-transform-commonjs.
- Ensure dependency still works, you may run npm test for that.
- Open a PR with the code written using `import/export` or use your fork directly.

You can reuse this strategy for dependency written in iife, amd or umd.

## Generator not supported

Because we miss a strategy to provide regeneratorRuntime and polyfill in general.

## Sourcemap broken

It's likely because `transform-async-to-promises` used together with `transform-modules-systemjs` generate bad sourcemap.
It means if you use async/await in a platform not supporting it, your sourcemap will not be able to point the original location.
