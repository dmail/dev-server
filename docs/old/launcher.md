# launcher

A launcher is a function capable to launch a runtime environment to execute a file.<br />
You can use them to tell on which runtime to execute a file.<br />

For instance the following code would execute `/Users/you/directory/index.js` on Node.js.

```js
import { execute, nodeRuntime } from "@jsenv/core"

await execute({
  projectDirectoryUrl: "/Users/you/directory",
  fileRelativeUrl: "./index.js",
  runtime: nodeRuntime,
})
```

# Browser launchers

Jsenv uses [playwright](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright) to launch browser runtime environments. If you want to use one of the browser launcher (_chromiumRuntime_, _firefoxRuntime_ or _webkitRuntime_) you need to:

1. Install browser executable dependencies

```console
npx playwright install-deps
```

2. Install browser executable

```console
npx playwright install
```

# Passing options to a launcher

You can pass option to a runtime launcher but you have to be sure you forward the options it receives.<br />
By default `chromiumRuntime` execute a file inside a headless chromium, but you can make it launch a chromium with a UI like this:

```js
import { execute, chromiumRuntime } from "@jsenv/core"

execute({
  projectDirectoryUrl: "/Users/you/directory",
  fileRelativeUrl: "./index.js",
  runtime: chromiumRuntime,
  runtimeParams: {
    headless: false,
  },
})
```
