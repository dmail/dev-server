# Example

> `executeTestPlan` is a function executing test files in one or several platforms logging progression and optionnaly generating associated coverage.

Implemented in [src/executeTestPlan.js](../../src/executeTestPlan.js), you can use it as shown below.

```js
const { executeTestPlan, launchNode } = require("@jsenv/core")

executeTestPlan({
  projectDirectoryPath: __dirname,
  testPlan: {
    "./test/**/*.test.js": {
      node: {
        launch: launchNode,
        allocatedMs: 5000,
      },
    },
  },
  logLevel: "info",
  coverage: true,
  coverageConfig: {
    "./index.js": true,
    "./src/**/*.js": true,
    "./**/*.test.*": false,
  },
  coverageJsonFile: true,
  coverageJsonFileRelativePath: "./coverage/coverage.json",
})
```

The code above executes every files ending with .test.js inside node and write the associated coverage into a file in json format.

# Parameters

`executeTestPlan` uses named parameters documented here.

Each parameter got a dedicated section to shortly explain what it does and if it's required or optional.

## testPlan

> `testPlan` is an object describing where are your test files and how they should be executed.

This is an optional parameter with a default value of:

```js
{
 "./test/**/*.test.js": {
  node: {
    launch: launchNode,
  }
}
```

`testPlan` parts are named `specifier`, `filePlan`, `executionName` and `executionOptions`.<br />
To better see what is named how, let's name every part of the default `testPlan`:

```js
const specifier = "./test/**/*.test.js"
const executionName = "node"
const executionOptions = {
  launch: launchNode,
}
const filePlan = {
  [executionName]: executionOptions,
}
const testPlan = {
  [specifier]: filePlan,
}
```

### specifier

`specifier` is documented in [https://github.com/jsenv/jsenv-url-meta#specifier](https://github.com/jsenv/jsenv-url-meta#specifier).

### executionName

`executionName` can be anything. up to you to name this execution.

### executionOptions

`executionOptions` can be `null`, in that case the execution is ignored.
It exists to prevent an execution planified by a previous specifier.

```js
{
  // execute every file twice on node (why not ^^)
  "./test/**/*.test.js": {
    node: {
      launch: launchNode,
    },
    node2: {
      launch: launchNode
    }
  },
  // but executes foo.test.js once
  "./test/foo.test.js": {
    node2: null
  }
}
```

`executionOptions` option are documented below:

#### launch

A function capable to launch a platform.<br />
This option is **required**

#### allocatedMs

A number representing the amount of milliseconds allocated for this file execution to complete.<br />
This option is optional with a default value of 30s.

#### measureDuration

A boolean controlling if file execution duration is measured and reported back.<br />
This option is optional with a default value of true.

When true `startMs`, `endMs` properties are availabe on every execution result inside [testPlanReport](#testPlanReport)

#### captureConsole

A boolean controlling if console logs are captured during file execution and reported back.<br />
This option is optional with a default value of true.

When true `platformLog` property is availabe on every execution result inside [testPlanReport](#testPlanReport)

#### collectNamespace

A boolean controlling if file exports are collected and reported back.<br />
This option is optional with a default value of false.

When true `namespace` property is availabe on every execution result inside [testPlanReport](#testPlanReport)

#### collectCoverage

A boolean controlling if coverage related to this execution is collected and reported back.

This option is optional with a default value of false.

When true `coverageMap` property is availabe on every execution result inside [testPlanReport](#testPlanReport)

#### logSuccess

A boolean controlling if execution success is logged in your terminal.<br />
This option is optional with a default value of true.

When false and execution completes normally nothing is logged.

## executionDefaultOptions

> `executionDefaultOptions` are the default option used to execute file.

This is an optional parameter with a default value of:

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
```js
{}
```

`executionDefaultOptions` was designed to define options shared by file execution.<br />
These option can be overriden per file using [testPlan](#testPlan) parameter.

For example the following code allocates 5s test file by default and 10s for `foo.test.js`

```js
executeTestPlan({
  executionDefaultOptions: {
    allocatedMs: 5000,
  },
  testPlan: {
    "./foo.test.js": {
      node: {
        launch: launchNode,
        allocatedMs: 10000,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

## concurrencyLimit

> `concurrencyLimit` is a number representing the max amount of execution allowed to run simultaneously.

This parameter is optional with a default value of

```js
Math.max(require("os").cpus.length - 1, 1)
```

To ensure one execution at a time you can pass `1`.

## measurePlanExecutionDuration

> `measurePlanExecutionDuration` is a boolean controlling if test plan execution duration is measured, logger and reported.

This parameter is optional with a default value of `false`.

When true, `startMs`, `endMs` properties are available on [testPlanSummary](#testPlanSummary).<br />
When true, a log will indicates test plan duration.

## Shared parameters

To avoid duplication some parameter are linked to a generic documentation.

# Return value

`executeTestPlan` returns signature is `{ summary, report, coverageMap }`

## testPlanSummary

> `testPlanSummary` is an object describing quickly how the testPlan execution went.

It is returned by `executeTestPlan`, see below an example

```js
const { summary } = await executeTestPlan({
  projectDirectoryPath: __dirname,
  testPlan: {},
})
```

returns

```js
{
  executionCount: 0,
  disconnectedCount: 0,
  timedoutCount: 0,
  erroredCount: 0,
  completedCount: 0
}
```

## testPlanReport

> `testPlanReport` is an object containing information about every test plan file execution.

It is returned by `executeTestPlan`, see below an example

```js
const { report } = await executeTestPlan({
  projectDirectoryPath: __dirname
  testPlan: {
    "./test/file.test.js": {
      node: {
        launch: launchNode,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

Returns

```json
{
  "./test/file.test.js": {
    "node": {
      "platformName": "node",
      "platformVersion": "8.9.0",
      "status": "completed",
      "startMs": 1560355699946,
      "endMs": 1560355699950,
      "platformLog": ""
    }
  }
}
```

## testPlanCoverageMap

> `testPlanCoverageMap` is an object is the coverage of your test plan, it aggregates every file execution coverage.

It is returned by `executeTestPlan`, see below an example

```js
const { coverageMap } = await executeTestPlan({
  projectDirectoryPath: __dirname
  testPlan: {
    "./test/file.test.js": {
      node: {
        launch: launchNode,
      },
    },
  },
  coverage: true
})
```

Returns an object like this one:

```json
{
  "src/file.js": {
    "path": "src/file.js",
    "statementMap": {},
    "fnMap": {},
    "branchMap": {},
    "s": {},
    "f": {},
    "b": {},
    "_coverageSchema": "1a1c01bbd47fc00a2c39e90264f33305004495a9",
    "hash": "4c491deb0eb163063ccae03693fa439ec01fcda4"
  }
}
```

## One execution = one platform

Each test file will be executed in his own browser or node.js process.

It reduces chances that a file execution have a side effect on an other file execution.
For instance executing code with an infinite loop crashes browser or node.js process. In that scenario that file would not prevent other file executions.

It also allows to execute files concurrently increasing speed on machine with mutiple processors.

## Execution error

Any value thrown during file execution sets execution status to errored and test is considered as failed.<br />
See below code that would trigger this scenario:

```js
throw new Error("here")
```

## Execution timeout

File execution taking longer than an allocated amout of milliseconds sets execution status to timedout and test is considered as failed.<br />
See below code that would trigger this scenario:

```js
await new Promise(() => {})
```

Note: By default an execution is given 30s before being considered as a timeout.

## Execution disconnection

Platform disconnected during file execution sets execution status to disconnected and test is considered as failed.<br />
See below code that would trigger this scenario:

```js
while (true) {}
```

Note: This code might either crash the platform (browser or node.js) resulting in disconnected or just timeout.

### Execution completion

When none of the aboves scenario occurs, execution status is success and test is considered as completed.s
See below code that would trigger this scenario:

```js
const actual = 10 + 10
const expected = 20
if (actual !== expected) {
  throw new Error(`10 + 10 should be 20`)
}
```

Note: An empty file is a completed test.
