Welcome in jsenv documentation for users!

This documentation is adressed to people considering to use jsenv for the first time or are already using it.

# A) Scope

The scope of jsenv is the set of situation where jsenv will be used to perform a task. Jsenv scope includes the following

- executing source file(s)
- executing a single test
- executing all tests
- build source files for production
- executing build files

Jsenv scope is large, meaning you have less tools to use and to maintain. It leads to a consistent dev experience where switching from a type of task to an other is quick and easy.

Finally jsenv promotes standards and does not impose any constraints on your files or the code written inside. This helps your code to be portable to other environment(s).

One of the main strengh of jsenv, relying on standard, is the ablity to have multiple HTML file in your source code. This flexibility allows to:

- Have more than one entry point
- Experiment things in independent files
- Create interactive documentation about your UI
- Write tests directly inside HTML files
- Many more things
