# assert [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@jsenv/assert.svg?logo=npm&label=package)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@jsenv/assert)

_@jsenv/assert_ is the NPM package used by jsenv to write tests.

It can be resumed by the following quote:

> equal() is my favorite assertion. If the only available assertion in every test suite was equal(), almost every test suite in the world would be better for it.

> â€” Eric Elliot in [Rethinking Unit Test Assertion](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/rethinking-unit-test-assertions-55f59358253f)

## Example

```js
import { assert } from "@jsenv/assert";

assert({
  actual: {
    foo: true,
  },
  expect: {
    foo: false,
  },
});
```

There is 200+ examples in [./tests/snapshots/](./tests/snapshots/README.md#Array)

## How it works

_assert_ does nothing when comparison is successfull but throws an error when comparison is failing.

## Features

### Colors

The message produced have colors that helps to see the diff.

- grey: same in actual and expect
- red: found in actual and is different
- green: found in expect and is different
- yellow: found only in actual or found only in expect

### Understand values

Comparison understand all js native values and make the diff more redable

```js
assert({
  actual: 149600000,
  expect: 1464301,
});
```

This includes things like comparison on url parts, date parts, http headers and many more.
