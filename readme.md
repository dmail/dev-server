# Presentation

`@jsenv/core` was first created to be able to write tests that could be executed in different browsers AND Node.js. In the end it became a tool covering the core needs of a JavaScript project:

- A test runner to execute test files.
- A developer friendly environment
- A builder/bundler to optimize files for production

Jsenv integrates naturally with standard html, css and js. It can be configured to work with TypeScript and React.

# Testing

`@jsenv/core` provides a test runner: A function executing test files to know if some are failing. This function is called `executeTestPlan`. Check steps below to get an idea of its usage.

<details>
  <summary>1. Create a test file</summary>

> In order to show code unrelated to a specific codebase the example below is testing `Math.max`. In reality you wouldn't test `Math.max`.

`Math.max.test.html`

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf8" />
    <link rel="icon" href="data:," />
  </head>
  <body>
    <script type="module">
      const actual = Math.max(2, 4)
      const expected = 4
      if (actual !== expected) {
        throw new Error(`Math.max(2, 4) should return ${expected}, got ${actual}`)
      }
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Create an other file to execute your test</summary>

`execute-test-plan.js`

```js
import { executeTestPlan, launchChromiumTab, launchFirefoxTab } from "@jsenv/core"

executeTestPlan({
  projectDirectoryUrl: new URL("./", import.meta.url),
  testPlan: {
    "**/*.test.html": {
      chromium: {
        launch: launchChromiumTab,
      },
      firefox: {
        launch: launchFirefoxTab,
      },
    },
  },
})
```

> This code above translates into the following sentence "Execute all files in my project that ends with `test.html` on Chrome and Firefox."

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Execute your tests</summary>

# Exploring

`@jsenv/core` provides a server capable to turn any html file into an entry point. This power can used to create a storybook, debug a file in isolation and more. This server is called `exploring server`. This server is designed for development: it provides livereloading out of the box and does not bundle files.

The following example shows how it can be used to execute a single test file. As mentioned previously it can execute any html file, not only test files.

<details>
  <summary>1. Create a file to start exploring server</summary>

```js
import { startExploring } from "@jsenv/core"

startExploring({
  projectDirectoryUrl: new URL("./", import.meta.url),
  explorableConfig: {
    source: {
      "**/*.html": true,
    },
  },
  compileServerPort: 3456,
})
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Start exploring server</summary>

![exploring command terminal screenshot](./docs/main/main-example-exploring-terminal.png)

</details>

<details>
    <summary>3. Open exploring server in a browser</summary>

When you open `https://localhost:3456` in a browser, a page called jsenv exploring index is shown. It displays a list of all your html files. You can click a file to execute it inside the browser. In our previous example we created `Math.max.test.html` so it is displayed in that list.

![jsenv exploring index page screenshot](./docs/main/main-example-exploring-index.png)

> Maybe you noticed the black toolbar at the bottom of the page? We'll see that further in the documentation.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>4. Open <code>Math.max.test.html</code></summary>

Clicking `Math.max.test.html` load an empty blank page because code inside this html file display nothing and does not throw.

![test file page screenshot](./docs/main/main-example-exploring-file-a.png)

</details>

To get a better idea of how this would integrate in everyday workflow, let's go a bit further and see what happens if we make test file throw. After that we'll revert the changes.

<details>
  <summary>5. Make <code>Math.max.test.html</code> fail</summary>

```diff
- const expected = 4
+ const expected = 3
```

The browser page is reloaded and page displays the failure. Jsenv also uses [Notification API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Notification) to display a system notification.

![test file failing page screenshot](./docs/main/main-example-exploring-failing.png)

![test file failing notification screenshot](./docs/main/main-example-failing-notif.png)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>6. Fix <code>Math.max.test.html</code></summary>

```diff
- const expected = 3
+ const expected = 4
```

Browser livereloads again and error is gone together with a system notification.

# Building

Building can be described as: generating files optimized for production thanks to minification, concatenation and long term caching.

Jsenv only needs to know your main html file and where to write the builded files. You can create a script and execute it with node.

Following the simplified steps below turns `index.html` into a production optimized `dist/main.html`.

<details>
  <summary>1. Create <code>index.html</code></summary>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" href="./favicon.ico" />
    <script type="importmap" src="./import-map.importmap"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./main.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <script type="module" src="./main.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

> To keep example concise, the content of the following files is not shown:
>
> - `favicon.ico`
> - `import-map.importmap`
> - `main.css`
> - `main.js`

</details>

<details>
  <summary>2. Create <code>build-project.js</code></summary>

```js
import { buildProject } from "@jsenv/core"

await buildProject({
  projectDirectoryUrl: new URL("./", import.meta.url),
  buildDirectoryRelativeUrl: "dist",
  enryPointMap: {
    "./index.html": "./main.html",
  },
  minify: false,
})
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>3. Execute <code>build-project.js</code></summary>

```console
node ./build-project.js
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>4. Open <code>dist/index.html</code></summary>

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <link rel="icon" href="assets/favicon-5340s4789a.ico" />
    <script type="importmap" src="import-map-b237a334.importmap"></script>
    <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="assets/main-3b329ff0.css" />
  </head>

  <body>
    <script type="module" src="./main-f7379e10.js"></script>
  </body>
</html>
```

> To keep example concise, the content of the following files is not shown:
>
> - `dist/assets/favicon-5340s4789a.ico`
> - `dist/import-map-b237a334.importmap`
> - `dist/assets/main-3b329ff0.css`
> - `dist/main-f7379e10.js`

# Features

Jsenv focuses on one thing: developer experience. Everything was carefully crafted to get explicit and coherent apis. This section list most important features provided by jsenv. Click them to get more details.

<details>
  <summary>Less context switching</summary>

One of the thing jsenv does well is to decrease harm caused by context switching.

Context switching: You are writing js that you are used to write every day for your project, then, you switch to unit tests. And, suddenly, you must adapt to new constraints imposed by the testing framework.<br />
â€” Read more in [I am too lazy for a test framework](https://medium.com/@DamienMaillard/i-am-too-lazy-for-a-test-framework-ca08d216ee05)

Jsenv provides a unified approach to this: [exploring](#exploring)

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Explicitness over magic</summary>

Jsenv also don't like blackboxes. `@jsenv/core` functions always choose expliciteness over magic. It makes things much simpler to understand and follow both for jsenv and for you.

> One example of expliciteness over magic: You control and tell jsenv where is your project directory. Jsenv don't try to guess or assume where it is.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Dispensable by default</summary>

Jsenv is **dispensable** by default. As long as your code is using only standards, you could remove jsenv from your project and still be able to run your code. You can double click your html file to open it inside your browser -> it works. Or if this is a Node.js file execute it directly using the `node` command.

Being dispensable by default highlights jsenv philosophy: no new concept to learn. It also means you can switch to an other tool easily as no part of your code is specific to jsenv.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Import maps</summary>

> This proposal allows control over what URLs get fetched by JavaScript import statements and import() expressions. This allows "bare import specifiers", such as import moment from "moment", to work.
>
> â€” Domenic Denicola in [WICG/import-maps](https://github.com/WICG/import-maps)

Jsenv supports import maps out of the box. The following html can be used with jsenv:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <title>Title</title>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <script type="importmap" src="./project.importmap"></script>
  </head>

  <body>
    <script type="module">
      import moment from "moment"
      console.log(moment)
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Top level await</summary>

> Top-Level await has moved to stage 3, so the answer to your question How can I use async/await at the top level? is to just add await the call to main()
>
> â€” Taro in [How can I use async/await at the top level?](https://stackoverflow.com/a/56590390/2634179)

Jsenv supports top level await out of the box. Top level await allow jsenv to know when a file code is done executing. This is used to kill a file that is too long to execute and know when to collect code coverage.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Dynamic import</summary>

> The lazy-loading capabilities enabled by dynamic import() can be quite powerful when applied correctly. For demonstration purposes, Addy modified an example Hacker News PWA that statically imported all its dependencies, including comments, on first load. The updated version uses dynamic import() to lazily load the comments, avoiding the load, parse, and compile cost until the user really needs them.
>
> â€” Mathias Bynens on [Dynamic import()](https://v8.dev/features/dynamic-import#dynamic)

Dynamic import are supported by jsenv. When building project using `buildProject`, dynamic import are turned into separate chunks.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>import.meta.url</summary>

> It's a proposal to add the ability for ES modules to figure out what their file name or full path is. This behaves similarly to \_\_dirname in Node which prints out the file path to the current module. According to caniuse, most browsers already support it (including the latest Chromium Edge)
>
> â€” Jake Deichert on [A Super Hacky Alternative to import.meta.url](https://jakedeichert.com/blog/2020/02/a-super-hacky-alternative-to-import-meta-url/)

Jsenv supports `import.meta.url`.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>Asset reference by url</summary>

A common pattern to reference an asset is to use an import statement. This import would actually return an url to the asset.

```js
import imageUrl from "./img.png"
```

As it's not standard, and will likely never be, it doesn't work in the browser without transformation. Using `import.meta.url` does work in the browser.

```js
const imageUrl = new URL("./img.png", import.meta.url)
```

You can use both patterns to reference an asset in jsenv. Prefer the one relying on `import.meta.url` because it would work without transformation.

</details>

<details>
  <summary>import.meta.dev</summary>

A common pattern to write code specific to dev environment consists into using `process.env.NODE_ENV` and rely on dead code elimination provided by tree shaking.

```js
if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== "production") {
  console.log("log visible only in dev")
}
```

Is transformed, when building for production, into a `false` constant and eliminated by tree shaking.

```js
if (false) {
  console.log("log visible only in dev")
}
```

But `process.env.NODE_ENV` is specific to Node.js. It would not work in a browser without transformation. Using `import.meta` it's possible to write something browser can understand.

```js
if (import.meta.dev) {
  console.log("log visible only in dev")
}
```

</details>

> The list above is non exaustive, there is more like long term caching, livereloading without configuration, service worker/worker support, ...

# Installation

```console
npm install --save-dev @jsenv/core
```

`@jsenv/core` is tested on Mac, Windows, Linux on Node.js 14.5.0. Other operating systems and Node.js versions are not tested.

# Configuration

Jsenv can execute standard JavaScript and be configured to run non-standard JavaScript.

Jsenv support standard JavaScript by default: [JavaScript Modules](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules), destructuring, optional chaining and so on.

Jsenv can be configured to execute non-standard JavaScript. For instance using [CommonJS modules](https://code-trotter.com/web/understand-the-different-javascript-modules-formats/#commonjs-cjs), [JSX](https://reactjs.org/docs/introducing-jsx.html) or [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org).

> Keep in mind one of your dependency may use non-standard JavaScript. For instance react uses CommonJS modules.

## jsenv.config.js

We recommend to regroup configuration in a `jsenv.config.js` file at the root of your working directory.

To get a better idea see [jsenv.config.js](./jsenv.config.js). The file is imported by [script/test/test.js](https://github.com/jsenv/jsenv-core/blob/e44e362241e8e2142010322cb4552983b3bc9744/script/test/test.js#L2) and configuration is passed [using spread operator](https://github.com/jsenv/jsenv-core/blob/e44e362241e8e2142010322cb4552983b3bc9744/script/test/test.js#L5). This technic helps to see jsenv custom configuration quickly and share it between files.

That being said it's only a recommendation. There is nothing enforcing or checking the presence of `jsenv.config.js`.

## CommonJS

CommonJS module format rely on `module.exports` and `require`. It was invented by Node.js and is not standard JavaScript. If your code or one of your dependency uses it, it requires some configuration.

<details>
  <summary><code>jsenv.config.js</code> to use code written in CommonJS</summary>

> The following `jsenv.config.js` makes Jsenv compatible with a package named `whatever` that would be written in CommonJS.

```js
import { jsenvBabelPluginMap, convertCommonJsWithRollup } from "@jsenv/core"

export const convertMap = {
  "./node_modules/whatever/index.js": convertCommonJsWithRollup,
}
```

</details>

## React

React is written in CommonJS and comes with JSX. If you use them it requires some configuration.

<details>
  <summary><code>jsenv.config.js</code> for react and jsx</summary>

```js
import { createRequire } from "module"
import { jsenvBabelPluginMap, convertCommonJsWithRollup } from "@jsenv/core"

const require = createRequire(import.meta.url)
const transformReactJSX = require("@babel/plugin-transform-react-jsx")

export const babelPluginMap = {
  ...jsenvBabelPluginMap,
  "transform-react-jsx": [
    transformReactJSX,
    { pragma: "React.createElement", pragmaFrag: "React.Fragment" },
  ],
}

export const convertMap = {
  "./node_modules/react/index.js": convertCommonJsWithRollup,
  "./node_modules/react-dom/index.js": (options) => {
    return convertCommonJsWithRollup({ ...options, external: ["react"] })
  },
}
```

## TypeScript

TypeScript needs some configuration if you use it.

<details>
  <summary><code>jsenv.config.js</code> for TypeScript</summary>

```js
import { createRequire } from "module"
import { jsenvBabelPluginMap } from "@jsenv/core"

const require = createRequire(import.meta.url)
const transformTypeScript = require("@babel/plugin-transform-typescript")

export const babelPluginMap = {
  ...jsenvBabelPluginMap,
  "transform-typescript": [transformTypeScript, { allowNamespaces: true }],
}

# About

## Name

The name `jsenv` stands for JavaScript environments. This is because the original purpose of `jsenv` was to blur the differences between two JavaScript runtimes: web browsers and Node.js. This aspect of `jsenv` is not highlighted in the documentation but it exists.

A more accurate name would be `jsruntime` but `jsenv` is lovely.

Maybe `jsenv` should be written `JSEnv`? It's too boring to hold `shift` on keyboard while typing `JSE`, then release `shift`, then type `nv`, so it's a no.

## Logo

The logo is composed by the name at the center and two circles orbiting around it. One of the circle is web browsers, the other is Node.js. It represents the two JavaScript environments supported by jsenv.
